''This class is the result of my researches about Glass Theme undocumented by Microsoft (idk why)
''Come from : https://withinrafael.com/2015/07/08/adding-the-aero-glass-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps/  ,
''https://gist.github.com/ysc3839/b08d2bff1c7dacde529bed1d37e85ccf  ,

''https://withinrafael.com/2018/02/02/adding-acrylic-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps-redstone-4-desktop-apps/ , 
''https://www.kechuang.org/t/79675  and
''https://gist.github.com/riverar/fd6525579d6bbafc6e48

''All listed projects seems based on a github repositoy : https://github.com/riverar/sample-win32-acrylicblur made By Rafael Rivera from Microsoft.

''DISCLAIMER  : TESTED ON WINDOWS 10 Version 1909 , System Ver : 18363.778 , Language : French , Theme : Dark

''All of thoses projects are researches of others coder and their testing. Also some of those projects may have strange behavior on Windows 10.

''Advices to use (add this in form loading) : 
''Dim j As MARGINS = New MARGINS()
''GlassTheme.SetAero7(Me.Handle, j)  ''Seems not to change anything
''GlassTheme.SetAero10(Me.Handle)
''Also use Black BackColor for better results
''I will also post results of strange behavior about projects above


''Most of those projects are made for wpf , not winform
''Currently translated in VBNET by Arsium for winform from working project there : https://gist.github.com/Trumeet/e5c4f35267464366aa6cd98b24e61346

''For my own tests , I've made a custom panel with many properties like draggable and gradient property.
''The way I've made my gradient property seems to override the blur effect (good think to make control not affected by this blur effect)
